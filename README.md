## Introduction

This project aims to finetune Llama 2, a powerful language model, on two specific datasets to enhance its performance in generating relevant and high-quality outputs. The finetuning process leverages LoRA, a technique that allows for efficient training by adapting a pre-trained model with a relatively low computational cost.

## Datasets

### MidJourney Prompt Dataset

The MidJourney prompt dataset consists of creative writing prompts, questions, and scenarios designed to inspire artistic and imaginative responses. This dataset helps in improving the model's ability to generate creative and contextually rich text.

### Instamart Dataset

The Instamart dataset contains e-commerce related data, including product descriptions, customer reviews, and queries. This dataset is aimed at enhancing the model's capability to understand and generate content related to online shopping and product information.

## LoRA

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a method for efficiently adapting pre-trained language models by introducing low-rank matrices to model weights. This allows for significant reductions in computational requirements and faster training times without sacrificing performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Datasets
- LoRA library
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
